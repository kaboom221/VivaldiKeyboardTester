Hello, just some edits to Chrultrabook key remaps that I wanted to make.

For good measure, please make a copy of C:\Windows\System32\drivers\croskbsettings.bin as backup. Then download the edited croskbsettings.bin here, put it in said directory (click yes to replace) and reboot your Chrultrabook. 

To revert to the default key remaps, put the backup croskbsettings.bin file into the above directory, then run C:\Program Files\crosec\croskbreload.exe or reboot your Chrultrabook.
